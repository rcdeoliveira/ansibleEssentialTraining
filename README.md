This repository hold my example files for
[LinkedIn's Ansible Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/ansible-essential-training/). Since example files from LinkedIn are Copyright protected, I would recommend download it and uncompress it under <Exercise Files> directory to keep referrence on comments.

## Lab ##
To save time, I ship laboratory definition out-of-the-box lab with Vagrant and VirtualBox (if you don't have it, install it first), also if you're running a Linux box, I would advice install apt-proxy-ng, this will create a service on your host operating system that will cache every package installed by your guest machines (look at <Vagrantfile> to uncomment line that enable this apt repository).
